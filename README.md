This Breakout game is created using C++ and Raylib.

The template that I've used is: https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE

After working on Java Breakout using Java Swing, I decided to make a new version of Breakout using C++ and Raylib. Along the way, I've made optimizations and improvements on the graphics, gameplay, & collision detection and handling.

While working on this project, I've understood more about how C++ was used to create applications, especially graphical applications.

Instructions: Use the arrow keys to move the paddle. You must clear all bricks in the current round to move on to the next round. The game is over if you clear all 6 rounds or you lose all of your lives.
